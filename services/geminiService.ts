    Analyze the following 5 Whys analysis text and score its complexity on three dimensions.
    The analysis is about a business problem.

    **5 Whys Analysis:**

    **Instructions:**
    Based on the text, evaluate the following three dimensions on a scale from 1 to 5.
    1.  **Cause Ambiguity (Ambiguit√† causa):** How clear, specific, and actionable is the identified root cause?
        - 1: Very clear, specific, and directly addressable root cause.
        - 3: Moderately clear, but might require some further investigation.
        - 5: Very vague, abstract, or multi-faceted root cause, hard to tackle directly.
    2.  **Interconnections (Interconnessioni):** How many other teams, processes, or systems are impacted by or involved in the problem and its cause?
        - 1: The issue is isolated to a single team or process.
        - 3: The issue affects 2-3 teams or systems.
        - 5: The issue is highly systemic, impacting multiple departments, critical processes, or the entire organization.
    3.  **Business Impact (Impatto sul business):** How critical is the problem to the business's core objectives (financial, operational, reputational)?
        - 1: Low impact, minor inconvenience.
        - 3: Moderate impact, causing noticeable operational issues or moderate financial loss.
        - 5: High to critical impact, threatening core business operations, significant financial loss, or major reputational damage.
